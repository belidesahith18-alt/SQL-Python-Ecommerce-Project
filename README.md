# SQL-Python-Ecommerce-Project
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The aim is to understand how customers purchase products, how much they spend, and which categories perform better.

Python was used to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis.
SQL queries were written to analyze customer purchases, spending patterns, and product-level trends.
Power BI was used to create dashboards that visualize key customer and sales metrics.

This project shows how data can be transformed into useful insights that help understand customer behavior and support basic business decisions.
